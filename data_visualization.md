<h3>Who old are you</h3>
David McCandless is a British data-journalist who became frustrated with the representation of data and narratives, especially by media. He believes that data should be visualized to displays obvious patterns, beauty, and elegance.
One of the pieces that I was interested in a piece called "Who old are you". The piece allows you to enter your age, and the output is the visualization of different successful famous people and when they achieved a certain milestone in their lives.

 This piece is was a reminder that we are all moving at our own pace in life. There is a massive pressure in the society to be in a specific place at a certain age. This visualization disproves the notion that one cannot achieve success past a certain age.

Star Wars theme Fertilization
I found this quite entertaining. It is a creative, and interesting way of displaying scientific data which is usually thought of abstract. This was an interesting and refreshing way of looking at abstract data.
